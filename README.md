# 📊 Personal Finance Dashboard

Overview

This project is a personal finance dashboard built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQL. It uses real data exported from YNAB to track spending, income, debt payoff, and progress toward long-term financial goals (including closing the Seattle rent gap).

The goal is twofold:
1. Practical: Create a tool I actively use to monitor and improve my finances.
2. Portfolio: Demonstrate data wrangling, analysis, and visualization skills on real-world data.

Features (Planned)
- ✅ Load and clean YNAB transaction exports
- ✅ Summaries by category and month
- 📊 Visualizations:
   - Income vs. Expenses
   - Category breakdown
   - Debt payoff tracker
- 🗄️ SQL backend for queries

Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQLite (planned integration)
- Jupyter Notebooks

How to Use
1. Export a YNAB transactions CSV → save to /data/. (or use the supplied dataset)
2. Open notebooks in /notebooks/.
3. Run cells to view analysis and charts.

Project Status
- Phase 1 (Current): Data load + basic summaries
- Next: Add first charts (category + monthly net cash flow)
